      <description>Hello, let‚Äôs get acquainted! My name is Kirill, but in the sphere of the Internet, I‚Äôm known as Zhora. You might ask why? Simply put, all my acquaintances are used to calling me this way.

      <description>Introduction With Godot 4.0 on the horizon a lot of people want to try out the new technologies that are coming with the new version.
One of these is the GDExtension system that will be replacing the older GDNative system. GDNative was introduced as a means to enhance the editor itself by embedding C++ libraries or new language bindings into Godot. This had the advantage that users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to build the engine themselves but import a dynamic library.</description>

      <description>The Godot Engine is nowadays one of most popular game engines (next to Unreal Engine and Unity) and that while being open-source and free to use without any royalties. There are LOTS of people contributing to the engine and I am very happy that I can now count myself to them. In this blog post, I want to explain how I got started contributing to Godot after being in awe for quite a while.</description>
