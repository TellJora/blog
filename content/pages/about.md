# **Hello, let’s get acquainted!**

My name is ***Kirill***, but in the sphere of the Internet, I’m known as Zhora. You might ask why? Simply put, all my acquaintances are used to calling me this way.

My journey in the field of cybersecurity began in 2022 when I started to learn about penetration testing and enrolled in the best course for Russian speakers, [WAPT](https://web-pentest.ru/) - Web Application Pentester. There, I learned about such web vulnerabilities in applications as **XSS** and **SQL Injection**.

On this platform, I would like to share useful information and my experience in **solving CTF tasks** with you. Also, I would like to introduce my checklists and discuss them with you.

Thank you for your attention :smile:
